Implement a system to find the top trending hashtags from a series of tweets.
Imagine you have a continuous stream of tweets coming in. Each tweet is a string with words, and some of these words are hashtags (preceded by the # symbol).
Sample Tweets:

"I love going to the beach #vacation #beachlife"
"Just had the best burger ever! #foodie"
"#vacation vibes are the best"
"Can't believe it's raining again #weather"
"Exploring the mountains today #vacation #adventure"

Given the list of tweets, design a function that returns the top 'n' trending hashtags based on their frequency.
E.G. For n=2, the output would be ["#vacation", "#beachlife"] based on the sample tweets above.
